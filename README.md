# nfl_analyses
Place to upload my public NFL related data analyses that I post on my twitter, https://twitter.com/ChiefsAnalytics.

If you want to replicate these and the data comes from nflscrapR, I highly recommend you use this code written by Lee Sharpe: https://github.com/leesharpe/nfldata
This will scrape the code, and do some data cleaning/feature engineering which I find very useful. 

If you're seeing a few cells in each notebook that aren't used, it's likely because I start from the same template notebook for almost all of my analyses (rather than starting from scratch). So there's certainly lines that aren't used (like hard coding the team colors, for instance) in the majority of these notebooks
