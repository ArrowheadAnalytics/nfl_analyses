# nfl_analyses
Place to upload my public NFL related data analyses that I post on my twitter, https://twitter.com/ChiefsAnalytics.

If you want to replicate these and the data comes from nflscrapR, I highly recommend you use this code written by Lee Sharpe: https://github.com/leesharpe/nfldata
This will scrape the code, and do some data cleaning/feature engineering which I find very useful.
